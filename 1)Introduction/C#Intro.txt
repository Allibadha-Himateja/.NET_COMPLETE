<h1>INTRODUCTION TO C#</h1>

what is c# 
it is a language obviously,The C# is a language avaliable inside the .NET FRAMEWORK

THE KEY FEATURES OF C# IS THAT 
it contains all the features of 
c++,vbnet and java and with more features

what can we able to do with this c# and .net framework
-Console application
-windows application
-web applications
-WEBAPI's
-Database applications
-mobile applications
-game development

WHAT IS .NET FRAMEWORK
the .net is a framework which is build on with C# programming language
this language have the above applications
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SO WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHY WE NEEDED THE .NET FRAMEWORK
before dotnet framework we are having the COM (component object model)

what is that COM
the COM is one of the microsoft frameworks which was used to build the windows application and web application

after that we got VB.net 
VB is another programming language
and that too have the same applications

SOO WHAT WAS THE ISSUES WITH THE COM 
disadvantages of the COM was
-- incomplete object oriented support which means it does not support the OOPS
-- and it is platfrom dependent

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE ANSWER FOR THESE ISSUES ARE:
.NET FRAMEWORK
(.) dot represents the oops orientation 
and NET is for Network Enabled Technology(internet)
so the full form of the .net is dot means oops and net means internet or network enabled technology


Q) do you know what is meaning of framework?
framework is a software ,it is a collection of many small services provided on the C# programming language

WHAT DOES THE .NET FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY PROVIDE:
TWO THINGS
1)BCL
2)CLR

1)BCL---it stands for Base Class Libraries
	these base classes are provided by microsoft
	that is we cannot able to write any of the c# code without the base classes

2)CLR--common language runtime
	this common language runtime is one of the key component in the .net framework
	that is responsible for converting the msil(MICROSOFT INTERMEDIATE CODE) into native code

FOR UNDERSTANDING IT IN DETAILS
LOOK AT THIS BELOW FLOW DIAGRAM

									source code ->language Compiler ->MSIL/IL(microsoft intermediate code)->
									CLR(common language runtime) ->Native Code-> Execute
	
lets look deeper into how does any C# code is compiled and executed in details inside the .net environment

steps:
1) WRITING OF CODE :
the c# code contains all the base class components and these are written using specific microsoft rules
	and this file is SAVED USING the extention
	".cs" EXTENTION 

2) COMPILATION OF CODE:
	first compilation is done from the c# code to microsoft intermediate code(MSIL)
	
	for compiling the C# files we are using the 
	"csc.exe" compiler(AS MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS LANGUAGE DEPENDENT COMPILER)
	after successfully compiling it into the IL code
	
	THE IL CODE MUST BE RECOMPILED AGAIN:
	this re compilation is done with the help of JIT(JUST IN TIME) compiler
	it takes the  MSIL code as input and it will convert it into native code

	WHAT IS NATIVE CODE YOU ASK?
	native code is ntng but machine native code 
	it is purely dependent of the host system......

3) EXECUTION OF THE CODE
	Execution is done with the help of CLR(common language runtime)
	
	this will take the native machine code and outstreams the result of the execution of the code

	IN ORDER TO EXECUTE THE C# FILE WHICH YOU HAVE COMPILED
	search for the file with same name as the previous file and with ".exe" extension

	simply do
	>>> MyFirst.exe


DOUBT 
WHAT WILL GENERATE THE .exe FILES WHEN THEY ARE COMPILED
	so the answer for this is 
	
	as the csc.exe (C# language compiler) will decide what to generate on basic of the kind of application

	assume that your contains main method 
	----- representing the Console application	
		so it generates the .exe extension files

	----- there is an exception in this .dll files
		the csc.exe compiler will generate the .dll files when the kind of the project is CLASS LIBRARY
		(THERE WILL BE DETAILED EXPLANATION ON HOW THE .dll files are created and what are those .....)
