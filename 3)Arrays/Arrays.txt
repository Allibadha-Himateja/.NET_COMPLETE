///
Arrays

the array is a linear data structure which stores data of same data type.

the syntax for declaring an array is

type  []<arrayname> = new <datatype>[size];
int [] arr=new int[5];

this is for the declaration of an array

Type of Arrays in C#:
single dimentional 
multi dimentional

single dimentional:
the declaration for single dimentional array is same as the declaration of the arrays inside java
but the 
 the [] brackers will come before the array_name 
 like so
 type  []<arrayname> = new <datatype>[size];
int [] arr=new int[5];


multi_dimentional:
the declaration of a multi dimentional array is so different from the java
that is 

data_type [,] array_name = new data_type[no_of_rows,no_of_cols]
example
int [,]a=new int[3,2](rows=3 and cols=2);

THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED TO able to know about the arrays in C#

there are names specified to represent particular array
1)Jagged array
	the jagged array are the arrays which rows and cols are not same
2)Rectangular Array
	the rectangular arrays have the same no of rows and cols
