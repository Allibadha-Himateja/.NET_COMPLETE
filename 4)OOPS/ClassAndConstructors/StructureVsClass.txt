/// this file includes all you need to know about the structures in .net

STRUCTURE:
Structure is a value type and a collection of variables of different data types under a single unit. 
It is almost similar to a class because both are user-defined data types and both hold a bunch of different data types.

Defining Structure: In C#, structure is defined using struct keyword.
Using struct keyword one can define the structure consisting of different data types in it. 

example

access_specifier struct Name
{
	Fields
	Parametorized constructor
	constants
	properties......

}

what is the actual difference between the Class and Structure

STRUCT IS A VALUE TYPE:::
VALUE TYPES STORES THE DATA DIRECTLY ON THE STACK.

AND CLASS IS A REFERENCE TYPE:::
WHILE REFERENCE TYPES STORE REFERENCE TO AN OBJECT CONTAINING THE DATA ON HEAP.


Structure will store only the simple/primitive data types ; where as the class stores more complex methods and properties

IN SIMPLE WORDS
The Structure is like a data structure which will store the data
but where as the Class will store the state and behaviour of a real world object

One major difference between structs and classes is that structs are value types, while classes are reference types.
This means that structs are copied by value when they are passed around, while classes are copied by reference.
