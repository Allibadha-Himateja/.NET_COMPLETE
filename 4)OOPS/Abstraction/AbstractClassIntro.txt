/// this file includes everything which you need to know about the abstraction in .net framework


The process of representing the essential features without including the background details is called Abstraction.
In simple words, 
we can say that it is a process of defining a class by providing the necessary details to call the object operations
(i.e., methods) by hiding its implementation details.

 in this concept of abstraction we are going to discuss about the 
 Abstract Classes
 Interfaces

 ABSTRACT CLASS:
 -the abstract class is a class which contain atleast one abstract method (OR)
 PURELY VIRTUAL METHOD
 - we cannot create the instance of the Abstract Class
	reason why they cannot be initialized is that the abstract class can have the abstract method
	which are the method with no implementation or incomplete statements
	it is not suitable to initialize these abstract classes
 - abstract class can contain concreate method (with body)
 - to use an abstract class we need to extend the class and override all the virtual methods in the derived classes
	otherwise the derived class will also become one abstract class


ABSTRACT METHOD:
	a method inside the abstract class which does not have any implmentation is called the abstract method


IMPLEMENTING THE ABSTRACTION ARE OF TWO WAYS:
1) via Abstract class and purely Virtual methods
2) via interfaces
