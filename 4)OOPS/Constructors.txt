//// this file include all you have to know about the constructor in dotnet

Constructor:
the constructor is a special kind of method inside a class 
the functionality of the constructor is to initialize the objects

THE CONSTRUCTOR OF ANY CLASS IN HANDLED:
-by the compiler itself or by user defined constructor

so for example there is a class

class Test
{
	int a;
}

inorder to initialize an object of this class

we will write inside the Main() method

Test t = new Test();

but we dont have any constructor inside the Test class 
the comipler will compile the code from this
class Test				class Test
{						{
	int a;		to			int a;
}							public Test()
							{
								a=0;
							}
						}
							
this process is done internally by the compiler
all the declared but not initialized objects inside the class are
initialized internally which compilation

AND THE DECLARED VARIABLES ARE ALWAYS ASSIGNED TO THE NULL 


USER DECLARED CONSTRUCTORS IN .NET
<access_modifiers> <class_name> ([<Parameter_list>])
{
	/// statements...
}

RULES F0R DECLARING A CONSTRUCTORS INSIDE A CLASS:
- the name of the constructor and the class name must be same
- there is no return type or return statements for a constructor
- we can only use the access_modifiers on constructor declarations

example
class MyClass
{
	int a;
	String b;
	public	MyClass(int a,String b)
	{
		this.a=a;
		this.b=b;

		// THIS KEYWORD IS USED FOR DEFINE THE CURRENT INSTANCE OF THIS CLASS ( A SPECIAL KEYWORD inside .net)
	}
}
