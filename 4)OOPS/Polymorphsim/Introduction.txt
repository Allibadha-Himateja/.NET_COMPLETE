// this file includes all you have to know about the polymorphism in oops 


what is polymorphism 
the polymorphism defines the concept of Method OverLoading and Method Overridding.

actually polymorphism word states the meaning of taking multiple roles or forms 
poly-many
morphs- forms


BEST EXAMPLE OF POLYMORPHISM 
take a child of age around 10
this kid has multiple roles on based on occasion or the surroundings
-shopping mall-Customer
-ClassRoom -student
-bus- passenger
-home-son


polymorphism is further classified into two types
1)Compile-Time/Method-OverLoading/Early Binding
2)Runtime/Method-Overridding/Late 

EXAMPLE FOR THE METHOD OVERLOADING IS 
this concept introduces declaration of method with same method names but with
DIFFERENT
1) parameters
2) return types...
class MethodOverLoad
{
	public void Add(int a,int b)
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"{a+b}");
	}
	public void Add(float a,float b)/////// with different parameters
	{
		Console.WriteLine($"{a+b}");
	}
	public string Add(string s,string y)///// with different return types
	{
		return ""+s+y;
	}

	this is a basic implementation of early binding or compile time polymorphism or the method overloading in .net
