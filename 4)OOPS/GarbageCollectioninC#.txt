/// this files includes all to discuss about the garbage collector in C#

what is a garbage collector:
as the name signifies the mechanism which is used to clean the unwanted things is called a garbage collector
in the context of C# 

when the C# application runs, lots of objects are being created 
at some point in the ececution the application may not be using the objects which are allocated with memory
so the functionality of the garbage collector is to handle the destruction of the objects which are not being used in the exection of the program

SO GARBAGE COLLECTOR IS A FEATURE PROVIDED BY THE CLR(common language runtime) inside the .net framework 
which will handle all the unwanted objects.
 THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR RUNS CONOTINOUSLY IN THE BACKGROUND THREAD AND WATCHES THE UNUSED MANAGED OBJECTS AND TRY TO DESTORY THEM....

NOTE:
the garbage collector only removes unused managed objects
it does not clean the unmanaged objects

WHAT ARE MANAGED AND UNMANAGED OBJECTS FOR GARBAGE COLLECTIONS

MANAGED OBJECTS:
the managed objects are the objects which are allocated in the memory heap and are in the control of garbage collector
these objects are typically the instances  of classes and structures in .net(new keyword.....)

UNMANGED OBJECTS:
the unmanaged objects arer the objects which are not managed by the GC...



THE GARBAGE COLLECTOR USE THE 
Finalize keyword automatically
it will remove all the unused objects from the memory

Dispose Method is used manually to deallocate or release the allocated resources on that object...
