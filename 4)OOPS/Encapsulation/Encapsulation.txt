/// this file includes all you need to know about encapsulation in C#

What is Encapsulation??

the encapsulation is one of the fundamental features of Object oriented programming
----
Encapsulation hides the internal state and functionality of an object 
and allows only access to the public set of functions.

the implementation of Encapsulation is done using the Access_Specifiers
they are also called as the Access_modifiers

what are the access_Specifiers
An access specifier defines the scope and visibility of the class member

C# supports six access_specifiers
1)public
2)private
3)protected
4)internal
5)private protected
6)protected internal

public: The public members can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
private: The private members can be accessed only by code in the same class.
protected: The protected Members in C# are available within the same class as well as to the classes that are derived from that class.
internal: The internal members can be accessed by any code in the same assembly but not from another assembly.
protected internal: The protected internal members can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it’s declared or from within a derived class in another assembly.
private protected: The private protected members can be accessed by types derived from the class that is declared within its containing assembly.
