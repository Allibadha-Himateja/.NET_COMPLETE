the file contains all about the console class

what is a console class
the console class is one of the fundamental classes provided in the base class library by microsoft inside the .net framework
this console class is specifically comes under the System namespace

this console class is responsible for handling the input,output and error streams for any console applications

so THE CONSOLE CLASS IS MOSTLY USED INSIDE THE CONSOLE APPLICATIONs

THE CONSOLE CLASS IS ONE OF THE STATIC CLASS IN .NET
a static class is a class which contains all members and methods as static 

the members of console class are
-title
-background color 
-foreground color 
-cursor size
and the methods are(which we mainly use in console applications are)
-Write("")
-WriteLine("") new line terminator
these both are string method which will write the values into the output stream
-Write(variable),WriteLine(variable) for variable

-Read() reads a single character from the keyboard and return its ascii value...
-ReadLine() reads a string from the keyword and returns what string has been entered when the enter key is been hit


some of the examples of the console class application are

-Console.Write("hi");
Console class is a static class 
-Console.WriteLine("Hello there");

-Console.Read() -reads only one character
-Console.ReadLine() -reads a string from the keyboard

 STRING INTERPOLATION IN C#
---assume that we are having 

string name=Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine($"hii {name}")
THIS IS CALLED STRING INTERPOLATION IN c#
			like we can able to use the $""  for inserting the values into the string (string interpolation)


HOW TO READ THE NUMBER OR ANY TYPE OF VALUE FORM THE KEYBOARD AND STORE THEM

int number=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
float temp=Convert.ToFloat(Console.ReadLine());
similarly for any data type we can able to type them 
WE HAVE TO TYPE CAST THEM IN ORDER TO STORE THEM INSIDE THE VARIABLES OF SUITABLE DATA TYPE...

THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH FOR TYPECASTING THE VALUE:
-----
that is 
Int.Parse(Console.ReadLine())
Double.Parse(Console.ReadLine())


WE CAN ABLE TO PARSE THE READLINE STRING INTO DESIRABLE TYPE BY USING THE PARSE METHOD
