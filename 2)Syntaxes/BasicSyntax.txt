------------

the C# programming language use the basic librabries which are provided by the microsoft
for every program which we write in c# we need the base libraries
System dll


so the systax of the C# looks like this

namespace Mynamespace
{
	<accessModifier> ClassName 
	{
		datamember1;
		datamember2;
		<accessmodifier> <returntype> Memberfunction1()
		{
			Statements.......
		}
		<accessmodifier> <returntype> Memberfunction1()
		{
			Statements.......
		}
	}
}

THE HIERARCHY OF THIS IS
NAMESPACE->CLASS->MEMBERS->BLOCKS->STATEMENTS

/////THE ACTUAL SYNTAX...
using System;

namespace MyFirstProject
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Welcome to C#.NET");
            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
} 

the terms which we have used in the basic syntax are
1)namespace
2)class
3)accessmodifiers
4)static,return type,main

namespace:
namespace is a keyword which is used to declare a scope that contains the set of related objects

class:
a class is simply a user-defined data type which contain both state and behavior.
the state is represented using the properties 
and behaviour is defined using the user-defined functions

accessmodifier:
access modifiers are internal part of object oriented programming 
these are implmentation of ENCAPSULATION IN oops
they are different types of accessmodifier we will dicuss them in detail in oops

static:is a keyword in C# which represents the that whatever the variable has using the static key
the memory for this variable is instanced only once and it is immutable 

main:The Main() inside any C# code is an entry point for execution
after compilation of the  c# file the execution of this compiled file will start from the main method itself.....
